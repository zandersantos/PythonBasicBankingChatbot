# Reflection:
## 1. Identify any challenges or issues you encountered while writing your functions.
-The biggest issue was understanding and getting the "side.effect" sections to work properly.
-I did not fully understand unit testing and needed to teach myself everything again
-There was a lot of information and testing to go through
## 2. Discuss the benefits and challenges of developing and using unit tests.
- Benefits: It simplified debugging, improved the code quality, made better code design, facilitated code refactoring, enabled continuous collaboration and enhanced collaboration
- Challenges: Very time consuming, lots of maintenance and can get lost easily if certain practices (naming conventions and properly organized) aren't followed  
-
